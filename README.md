# Twitch Box

Twitch Box is an APP which will make watching twitch streams easier.

You could use the app either as a visitor or as a logged in user.

## For a visitor, you have the following choices:

1.  You could select several channels you are interested by clicking them, then click the "watch streams" button on sidebar to watch them. If you want to watch streams of a specific game, use the "Browse channels by game" selector, which could be found at the bottom of the home page.

2.  You could manully type in the name of the channels you are interested in then watch them, by clicking the "Add streams by name" button on sidebar.

3.  If you click the "Go to random multistream" button on sidebar, up to 4 random streams would be shown.

4.  While watching your chosen streams, you could edit streams by clicking "Edit" button on sidebar, as well as share the streams you are watching by click "Share" button on the sidebar.

5.  You could make a certain stream's chat as currently active chat, by clicking the chat selector on the up-right cornor. You could also achive this effect by click on the chat icon on the individual stream menu (which is hidden by default, will shown by hovering on a certain stream.)

6.  You could make a reaction by clicking on the thumb, heart or smile icon on a stream's overlay menu, all other viewers using Twitch Box could see this reaction if they are watching the same channel and the streamer has their widget embedded into the stream.
