# Twitch Box

Twitch Box is an APP which will make watching twitch streams easier.

You could use the app either as a visitor or as a logged in user.

## For a visitor, you have the following choices:

1.  A visitor could select several channels he’s interested by clicking them, then click the "watch streams" button on the sidebar to watch them. If he wants to watch streams of a specific game, he could click the "Browse channels by game" selector, which could be found at the bottom of the home page.

2.  A visitor could manually type in the name of the channels he’s interested in then watch them, by clicking the "Add streams by name" button on the sidebar.

3.  If a visitor click the "Go to random multistream" button on the sidebar, up to 4 random streams would be shown.

4.  While watching his chosen streams, a visitor could edit streams by clicking "Edit" button on the sidebar, as well as share the streams you he’s watching by clicking "Share" button on the sidebar.

5.  A visitor could make a certain stream's chat as currently active chat, by clicking the chat selector on the up-right corner. A visitor could also achieve this effect by clicking on the chat icon on a stream’s overlay menu (which is hidden by default, and will show by hovering mouse on a certain stream.)

6.  A visitor could make a reaction by clicking on the thumb, heart or smile icon on a stream's overlay menu, all other viewers using Twitch Box could see this reaction if they are watching the same channel and the streamer has their widget embedded into the stream.

## For a logged in user, you have more choices:

1.  All his followed channels on Twitch would be listed on the sidebar, he could click to select them to watch.

2.  While watching streams, a logged in user could make clips of these streams (previous 30 seconds' stream), and save them locally for later watching.

3.  On home page, by clicking "View My Info" on Navbar, a logged in user could view his Twitch profile, the multi-streams you've ever watched, as well as the clips he’s ever made.
